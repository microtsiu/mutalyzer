# We follow a versioning scheme compatible with setuptools [1] where the
# package version is always that of the upcoming release (and not that of the
# previous release), post-fixed with ``.dev``. Only in a release commit, the
# ``.dev`` is removed (and added again in the next commit).
#
# Note that this scheme is not 100% compatible with SemVer [2] which would
# require ``-dev`` instead of ``.dev``.
